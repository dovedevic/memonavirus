> Hey r/memes, tldr; we have a fun community event that will span the remainder of this crazy month of March. Patient zero will be identified in this thread below, after 2 days. Patients of the memonavirus will have a flair similar to the flair I currently have (Yellow Flair saying "Infected"). Commenting under a user who is infected will get you infected. Commenting on a post that is infected will infect you with a 1% chance. At the end of the event, two meta-memes threads will open for memes about the event. Awards will be given out to those that made exceptional memes or downright funny memes about the event. **For those infected, 3% will be banned for the shortest period of time.** 
> 
> **Additional note, meta-memes about the event are permitted as normal submissions, so long as they follow the rules in general.**
> 
> Okay so, the nitty gritty. It's obvious that these are some trying times both physically and mentally with the COVID-19 outbreak. As most of us are now spending more time online or indoors, it's more than ever important to keep yourself happy, entertained, and above all, healthy. In light of recent events, we designed this fun community event to draw attention to how fast the outbreak can spread, but also to have some comedy and ease your fears. 
> 
> So here's the game; below I will comment a sticky asking for volunteers to be our patient zero. Our patient zero will be awarded community coins for their efforts. Please keep in mind though, because reddit is reddit, please heavily consider if you truly want to be the first patient to set things off. A random user(s) will be selected.
> 
> This user (or users) will be given the infected flair and be instructed to use reddit on our sub as he or she normally does. Posting, commenting, interacting, etc. Anytime a user comments under this patient, they will be infected (either immediately if its a reply to a comment, or with 1% chance if commenting on a post). Then the cycle repeats for the next infected person, who will have the same flair as our patient zero.
> 
> While all of this is happening, I'll be keeping track with our bots to track the progress of the Memonavirus. Other accolades such as "biggest infector", "most brave" and others will be tracked and be awarded in the ending threads. Other fun and informative statistics will also be collected, and, if you are a researcher and are interested in the data, feel free to reach out!
> 
> At the end of the month, the virus will stop spreading automatically and two posts will be opened for meta memes from both survivors and infectors. Awards will be given out to those who produce fantastic memes. In order to qualify, you will have had to make at least 5 comments anywhere in the subreddit.
